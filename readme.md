READ-ME

This project was especially difficult for me in the terms of understanding the JSON & .FS. Ultimately I was unable to understand .FS or use it within the project. I spent most of the time trying to understand the JavaScript and fully understand it when implemented. I used the help of a few online resources such as W3Schools & referenced a few videos online as well to help me develop the CSS.

The most fun I had during this project was the fact that I was creating a working/running application for my first. I consider it a small step to what else is yet to come in my creation process through tech.

My biggest points I'd like to improve in are:
1. JavaScript understanding
2. Use of working with Json & .FS, as well as databases.
